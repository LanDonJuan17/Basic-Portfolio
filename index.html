    <p class="intro">My name is Landon Patrick Evans. I was born and raised here in Kansas and have lived in the same house for the last 24 years. I'm the oldest of four kids, it's me, mom and dad, then my brother Alex, 25, my sister Madi, 22, and my youngest brother Ethan, 21. I graduated from Olathe East Senior High School in '09 and studied at BYU in Provo, Utah for that summer semester right after High School. That fall I left to serve a two year mission for my church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Dat Saints, in Los Angeles, CA. It was definitely the hardest thing ive ever done in my life, leaving behind my everyday life, family, and friends to go serve and teach people but it taught me a lot of very useful life skills and the true value of hard work.</p>
    <p class="intro">Upon returning from LA, I went back to BYU to continue my undergrad. The next four years living in Utah were full of making several lasting friendships along with many, many experiences, some good, a lot bad, a few funny, and sad, that led to me unfortuantely not finishing my degree. I then started working full time for a company called Vivint.Solar. It was there that I realized my love of being able to work on a computer everyday in an office setting. Over the next 16 months I learned a lot of great computer skills and had a lot of experience working with a team on projects. Then all of a sudden the week before the fourth of July, 2015, I had this strange overpowering impulse that I needed to move home, right then. It was one of those gut feelings that you just cant ignore and just act on without knowing why but having the overwhelming assurety that there is a good reason behind it. So I put in my two weeks notice at work which they promptly accepted, thanked me and graciously allowed me to leave after one or two days once all my work was redistributed. I then set to work packing up my two door Toyota Solara with all my essential possesions, cleaned out the room I was renting, and within that week after leaving my job I said goodbye to my friends and just started driving home to Kansas. The next few months ended up being some of the most eventful times of my life.</p>
    <p class="intro">Over the next two months I was able to be at my brother Alex's wedding and suffered the loss of both of my Grandparents, my dad's side, within three weeks of eachother. I'm forever grateful that I got to spend those last two months with them before they passed and it was then that I realized this was the reason I had that urge to move home so suddenly. Since then my life has been a roller coaster of ups and downs that thankfully have led me to this amazing opportunity to learn a career and set myself down a path that will lead me to an infinitely bright future.</p>
